# Scientific Online ToolKit

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to establish an online resource toolbox that will help the computational science and engineering (CSE) and high-performance computing (HPC) communities better develop and implement best practices in scientific software. The toolkit will contain online seminars, tutorials, and guidelines on three important topics: effective HPC software use, repeatability frameworks, and version control and cooperation. The goal of this program is to increase the sustainability, performance, and quality of scientific software by making these resources broadly available.

Social media, conferences presentations, and partnerships with the BSSw community will all be used to market the toolkit, which will be housed on an online platform. Through interactive workshops, researchers and developers will have the chance to interact with this knowledge, promoting the use of repeatable and scalable software processes. Participant comments, resource engagement measures, and observable enhancements to users' scientific processes will all be used to gauge the project's success.
